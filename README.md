# AirBnB Clone Project! üè†‚ú®
Airbnb Clone is a full-stack web application that mimics the core functionality of Airbnb: users can browse, filter, and book short-term rental listings; hosts can create and manage their own listings; and both parties can review past stays.

## Tech Stack
- Front-End
   - React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, TailwindCSS for styling.
- Back-End
    - Python, Django, and MySQL
-  Other tools
   - Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration, Jest for testing.


## UI/UX Design Planning
A user-friendly booking interface streamlines the reservation process by minimizing form fields and guiding users with clear calls-to-action while building trust through transparent pricing and security. To achieve this I intend to implement the following key features.

The key features implemented in this project include the following
- Property Listing View
     - This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.

- Listing Detailed View
    - This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property‚Äôs name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters.

- Simple Checkout View
    - This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience.

- Search Functionality
    - A robust search feature enabling users to find properties based on criteria like location, price, and availability.

Identifying a mock-up‚Äôs design properties‚Äîsuch as its layout grid, typography choices, color palette, and interactive elements‚Äîis essential for ensuring visual consistency, maintaining brand integrity, and guiding developers and stakeholders in translating a static concept into a functional product
